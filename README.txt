This project requires python environment for execution. Python 2.7
1. For installation help please follow steps on this link http://quant-econ.net/py/getting_started.html (specifically look for point with "Installing Anaconda" title)
2. Install Numpy libraries using this link http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html (Do it for the kind of OS you are working on)

There are two folders with code.
1. Feedback
2. Concept

Each folder consist of ExecuteAll.py file.
Execute this file to get the results.
This will execute the Combined, Graph and Jaccard code in a single run.
If needed to execute differently then open the desired file. Look for "def main():" code line. Comment this and look for "# if __name__ == "__main__":" and uncomment it. Now execute seperately.

Results: 
1. Look for Files and Images folder inside.
2. These folders have well defined segregation of files and hence is easy to follow. Look for different thresholds inside (10,15,20,25)
